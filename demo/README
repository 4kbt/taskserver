Demonstration
-------------

This is used for development, testing and debugging.  There are scripts:

  run.setup
    Sets up a task server instance using /tmp/taskd.data as the data root, and
    /tmp/taskd.log as the log file.  Listens on post 6544, in plaintext mode.

  run.server
    Clears the log file, and launches the server.

There are also data files, which are used as requests and send as-is to a
running server instance.  The files are:

  stats.0
    Requests server statistics.

  sync.1
    Requests a sync, but provides no synch key, and no transactions, therefore
    simulating an existing client user that is syncing for the first time.

The data files are numbered (*.0, *.1 ...) which indicates the sequence in which
they are expected to be sent as requests.  They are sent using the 'client'
command:

  taskd client localhost:6544 stats.0
  taskd client localhost:6544 sync.1


Build / Install
---------------

Follow these command to build and install taskd.  Note that the tests are all
expected to pass.  If they do not all pass, do not install taskd.

  $ git clone git://tasktools.org/taskd.git taskd.git
  ...
  $ cd task.git
  $ cmake .
  ...
  $ make
  ...
  $ cd test
  $ make
  ...
  $ ./run_all
  ...
  $ cd ..
  $ sudo make install

Run these commands to verify your installation:

  $ taskd --version
  ...
  $ taskd --diagnostics
  ...
  $ taskd
  ...

You should see a version, copyright and license information.  The diagnostics
option provides details about the build environment.  The last command should
present a list of commands that can be run.


Example Session
---------------

Follow these commands for a sample session:

  $ ./run.setup
  $ ./run.server &
  $ taskd client localhost:6544 stats.0
  ...
  $ taskd client localhost:6544 sync.1
  ...
  $ fg
  ^C
