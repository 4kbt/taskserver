1  Introduction

   Operating your own Task Server is straightforward.  You will need the
   following:

   - A machine capable of running the Task Server.  See the NEWS file for a list
     of platforms and operating systems on which Task Server has been tested.
     There are likely other combinations that support Task Server that have not
     been tested.

   - Connectivity from your client to your server.  This may involve firewall or
     VPN, but access is needed.

   - An open port.  The default is 6544.

   - Tools:  C++ compiler, CMake, make, Perl and Python, Gnu certtools

   - Libraries:  GnuTLS, libuuid

   - Storage: enough storage for task list history per user.  A guideline for
     usage is 1MiB per user, per year.


1.1  Requirements

   In this document, we adopt the convention discussed in Section 1.3.2 of
   [RFC1122] of using the capitalized words MUST, REQUIRED, SHOULD, RECOMMENDED,
   MAY, and OPTIONAL to define the significance of each particular requirement
   specified in this document.

   In brief: "MUST" (or "REQUIRED") means that the item is an absolute
   requirement of the specification; "SHOULD" (or "RECOMMENDED") means there may
   exist valid reasons for ignoring this item, but the full implications should
   be understood before doing so; and "MAY" (or "OPTIONAL") means that this item
   is optional, and may be omitted without careful consideration.


2  Installation & Setup

   Clone the git source repository using:

      $ git clone git://tasktools.org/taskd.git taskd.git

   Use the 'master' branch, which always represents the current stable release,
   build and install.

      $ cd taskd.git
      $ cmake .
      $ make
      $ cd test
      $ make
      $ ./run_all

   Only proceed if there are no test failures.

      $ cd ..
      $ sudo make install

   Verify your build and installation with the diagnostics command:

      $ taskd diagnostics

   A data 'root' is needed.  This will be the root of the directory structure
   that will store all the data.  Choose a root location, create the directory
   and initialize the server:

      $ export TASKDDATA=/path/to/task/server/data
      $ mkdir -p $TASKDDATA
      $ taskd init --data $TASKDDATA

   Basic configuration is needed before the server can be started.  The config
   command makes use of the TASKDDATA variable, otherwise you need to specify
   '--data /path/to/task/server/data' with each command.

      $ taskd config log      /path/to/taskd.log
      $ taskd config pid.file /path/to/taskd.pid
      $ taskd config ip.log   1

   The next step is to allow/deny specific clients.  Taskwarrior has a client
   defined as 'task 2.3.0', so to allow that:

      $ taskd config client.allow 'task [2-9]'
      $ taskd config client.deny none

   Note that the values are regular expressions, and it is necessary to allow
   for some flexibility in the version number.  The above is a very general
   pattern, but it could be more specific.  To allow any client, do this:

      $ taskd config client.allow all
      $ taskd config client.deny none

   To override the confirmation question for each of the above, you can specify
   the '--force' option:

      $ taskd config --force ip.log 1

   View the current configuration with:

      $ taskd config


3  Updates

   Updating Task Server involves a clone of the repository, build, test and
   install, then a server bounce.

      $ git clone git://tasktools.org/taskd.git taskd.git
      $ cd taskd.git
      $ cmake .
      $ make
      $ cd test
      $ make
      $ ./run_all

   Only proceed if there are no test failures.

   Check the ChangeLog and NEWS files in the distribution for any new or
   obsolete configuration settings that may need to be changed.

      $ cd ..
      $ sudo make install
      $ taskdctl restart


4  PKI

   *****************************************************************************
   Warning

   These instructions refer to self-signed certs which are not suitable for
   production use.
   *****************************************************************************

   The server needs a cert, key and crl.  For testing purposes, there is a
   script that will do all of this:

      $ cd taskd.git/pki
      $ ./generate

   Once the various files are created, install them in $TASKDDATA:

      $ cp client.cert.pem $TASKDDATA
      $ cp server.cert.pem $TASKDDATA
      $ cp server.key.pem $TASKDDATA
      $ cp server.crl.pem $TASKDDATA

   Configure the server to use them:

      $ taskd config client.cert $TASKDDATA/client.cert.pem
      $ taskd config server.cert $TASKDDATA/server.cert.pem
      $ taskd config server.key $TASKDDATA/server.key.pem
      $ taskd config server.crl $TASKDDATA/server.crl.pem

   Note that the 'client.cert.pem' is intended for use by Task Server clients
   clients like Taskwarrior and the 'taskd client ...' interface.

   Ordinarily, a new 'client.cert.pem' is generated for each user.

   For every client of the Task Server, you will need to generate a new
   'client.cert.pem' file, using this:

      $ cd taskd.git/pki
      $ ./generate.client

   The resultant 'client.cert.pem' file is needed by the client.


5  Server Start/Stop

   There is a 'taskdctl' script to perform start/stop/restart.  Use it like
   this:

      $ export TASKDDATA=/path/to/task/server/data
      $ taskdctl start
      $ taskdctl restart
      $ taskdctl stop

   This script is just a convenience, and you can directly run the commands.  To
   start the server:

      $ taskd server --data /path/to/task/server/data

   Or if the TASKDDATA variable is defined:

      $ taskd server

   This can be terminated with Ctrl-C.  To start a daemon server:

      $ taskd server --daemon

   The daemon server needs to be terminated with a kill.  See the pid.file
   config setting for the PID.


6  User Configuration

   The 'config' command is used here to illustrate how to manage users of a task
   server.  The structure of the user accounts is such that future expansion to
   include organizations and groups will not require changes to the data root.


6.1  General

   Note that all taskd commands shown support the TASKDDATA environment variable
   but also support '--date /path/to/task/server/data' as well.  In these
   examples, the former is assumed to be set:

      $ export TASKDDATA=/path/to/task/server/data

   Note that the 'taskdctl' script requires TASKDDATA.


6.2  Organizations

   An Organization is the top-level structure on the server.  A user MUST belong
   to one Organization.

   In this example, one organization named 'Public' is created.  An organization
   may contain multiple words, but may not contain a slash (U+002F).

      $ taskd add org Public

   An organization can be removed permanently with:

      $ taskd remove org Public

   This is a destructive command, and not recommended.  It will remove an entire
   set of related groups and users.

   You may suspend an organization:

      $ taskd suspend org Public

   This will prevent any users in that organization from using the server.  This
   is one way to take the server offline, while keeping it running.  A suspended
   organization can be restore with:

      $ taskd resume org Public

   The server supports an unlimited number of organizations.


6.3  Groups

   Groups are equivalent to shared task lists within an organization.  Groups
   are not yet supported.

   The data structures for groups is managed in a similar way to organizations,
   using these commands:

      $ taskd add     group <org> <group>
      $ taskd remove  group <org> <group>
      $ taskd suspend group <org> <group>
      $ taskd resume  group <org> <group>


6.4  Users

   A user must be added to an organization.  When adding a user, a key is
   generated and shown.  This is a user-specific secret key that is needed by
   the client.  For example:

      $ taskd add user Public John_D
      New user key: 1b89dd01-7a33-4890-815f-1f87f090cbe8

   Note that a PKI cert is also needed, see the PKI section.

   The data structures for users is managed in a similar way to organizations,
   using these commands:

      $ taskd add     user <org> <user>
      $ taskd remove  user <org> <key>
      $ taskd suspend user <org> <key>
      $ taskd resume  user <org> <key>


7  Backups

   The data needing backup consists of only one directory, which is the data
   root.  It is recommended that the server be taken offline for this:

      $ taskdctl stop
      $ <your backup program here>
      $ taskdctl start

   Rotating the task server log file requires the same care.


8  Monitoring

   The task server has a client interface, where arbitrary requests can be sent.
   This can include the 'statistics' request.  Here is an example:

      $ cat stats.request
      type: statistics
      org: <Organization>
      user: <User>
      key: <Key>
      client: taskd 1.0.0
      protocol: v1
      
      
      $

   Note that the request file has two blank lines at the end.  You will need to
   provide a valid organization, user and key.  Once you have a valid request
   file, use the 'client' command to send the request to the server.  The
   response is shown in raw form:

      $ taskd client localhost:6544 stats.request
      >>> stats.request
      <<<
      average request bytes: 0
      average response bytes: 0
      average response time: 0.000000
      code: 200
      errors: 0
      idle: 1.000000
      maximum response time: 0.000000
      status: Ok
      total bytes in: 0
      total bytes out: 0
      tps: 0.000000
      transactions: 1
      uptime: 28
      client: taskd 1.0.0

   This response shows a task server that has been running for only 28 seconds,
   and has processed one transaction.  This response can be easily parsed and
   stored for monitoring purposes.
