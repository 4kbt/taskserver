Welcome To Task Server Alpha
----------------------------

The alpha release of the task server is intended to test the functionality and
documentation.  It is not for casual users.  It is not for anyone who wishes to
use the server in a production environment.  It is not for anyone who is
unfamiliar with the operation of daemons.  It is not for anyone who does not
take proper precautions with their data.


Demonstration
-------------

There is a demonstration, which illustrates various aspects of the task server:

  demo/README


Documentation

You will find documents in the doc directory, but specifically you will find the
