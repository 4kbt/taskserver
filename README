Welcome To Taskserver
---------------------

Taskserver will allow you set up a server so your Taskwarrior client (and
others, coming soon) can share tasks.

Taskserver is a complex daemon process.  It is not for anyone who is unfamiliar
with the operation of daemons.

Taskserver is compatible with Taskwarrior version 2.3.0 and later, but works
best with the latest Taskwarrior.


Easy Setup
----------

There is a setup script that will lead you through all necessary steps to setup
the Taskserver, create certs, configure a client and sync:

  script/setup_server.bash


Documentation
-------------

The documentation has been moved online, so we can continually improve it:

  http://taskwarrior.org/docs/

In addition there are two man pages installed:

  taskd(1)
  taskdrc(5)


Known Issues
------------

Please see this page for a list of issues, and their status:

  Taskwarrior         https://bug.tasktools.org/browse/TW
  Taskserver          https://bug.tasktools.org/browse/TD

It is generally recommended that you pull latest changes for both projects as
often as possible, to benefit from bug fixes.
