Welcome To Task Server Alpha
----------------------------

The alpha release of the task server is intended to test the functionality and
documentation.  It is not for casual users.  It is not for anyone who wishes to
use the server in a production environment.  It is not for anyone who is
unfamiliar with the operation of daemons.  It is not for anyone who does not
make proper precautions with data.


Demonstration
-------------

There is a demonstration, which illustrates many aspects of the task server:

  demo/README


Documentation
-------------

You will find documents in the doc directory, but specifically you will find the
operation guide:

  doc/operation.txt

This document guides you through installation and setup.

In addition there are two man pages installed:

  taskd(1)
  taskdrc(5)
