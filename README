Welcome To Taskserver
---------------------

Taskserver will allow you set up a server so your Taskwarrior client (and
others, coming soon) can share tasks.

Taskserver is a complex daemon process.  It is not for anyone who is unfamiliar
with the operation of daemons.


Demonstration
-------------

There is a demonstration, which illustrates various aspects of the Taskserver:

  demo/README

Please note that the demonstration makes use of self-signed certificates, which
are not intended for production use.


Documentation
-------------

You will find documents in the doc directory, but specifically you will find the
operation guide:

  doc/operation.txt

This document guides you through installation and setup.

In addition there are two man pages installed:

  taskd(1)
  taskdrc(5)


Known Issues
------------

Please see this page for a list of issues, and their status:

  Taskwarrior         https://bug.tasktools.org/browse/TW
  Taskserver          https://bug.tasktools.org/browse/TD

It is generally recommended that you pull latest changes for both projects as
often as possible, to benefit from bug fixes.
