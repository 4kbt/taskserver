GnuTLS Demo Programs

The 'c' (client) and 's' (server) programs are based on public domain examples
from the GnuTLS release.  The cert.pem and key.pem files are from the GnuTLS
release, and will be replaced asap.

GnuTLS 2.12.20 or later is assumed.

Build the keys, certs and crl:

  cd pki
  ./build
  cd ..

Build the source using:

  ./build

Test using this:

  ./s &
  ./c
